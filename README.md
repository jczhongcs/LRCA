# LRCA: Local Residue Cooperation Architecture for Enhanced Prediction of Bile Acid–Related Enzymes with Protein Language Models
LRCA takes residue level embeddings from the pretrained ESM 2 model and applies a LocalRelation module to model dependencies among neighboring residues. This module enriches fine grained features associated with bile acid catalytic specificity while retaining global contextual information.
